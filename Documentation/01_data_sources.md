## Data Sources

All data used in this project comes from the CMS Hospital Compare program
and was downloaded directly from data.cms.gov.

### Files Used
- Hospital_General_Information.csv
- Medicare_Hospital_Spending_Per_Patient-Hospital.csv

### Data Period
January 1, 2023 – December 31, 2023

CMS datasets are published from multiple internal systems and do not
share a uniform schema or data typing, which introduces integration
challenges addressed later in this project.
